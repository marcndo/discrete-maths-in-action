# Discrete Math in Action
Welcome to **Discrete Math in Action**, a hands-on repository designed to help you learn and apply Discrete Mathematics concepts through real-world algorithmic problems using Python, LeetCode, and HackerRank.


## Objective
Build deep understanding of mathematical foundations behind algorithms, enhance problem-solving skills, and translate concepts from math into code and proofs.

## How to Use This Repo
1. Start with the chapter folders.
2. Read the `notes.md` to refresh concepts.
3. Run `examples.py` to see how math becomes code.
4. Try solving the listed problems in `leetcode_problems.md`.
5. Track your progress in the [tracker](../tracker/discrete-math-tracker.xlsx) and Notion.
